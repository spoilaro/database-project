## Instructions

Commands to get the interface running:
```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

The repository comes with the database already initialized. But if wanted, the database can be deleted and new generated by running these commands:
```
$ rm gpu_system.db
$ sqlite3 gpu_system.db < create_tables_gpu.sql
```
After this a new and empty database has been created. To populate tables with example data, run the python interface and select the option to initialize data from the menu.
